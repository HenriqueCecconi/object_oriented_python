# Learning about object oriented python

This repo is a study repo. I will use it for learning object orientation with python.

It will consist of three little situations of real life: 
- A basic bank account
- An employee classification by seniority
- A series and films catalog

These are simple examples for me to understand better OOP concepts like:
Classes and objects, attributes and methods, when to make them private, cohesion, getters and setters, propertys and decorators, static and class methods, inheritance and multiple inheritance, polymorphism, dunders, duck typing, Abstract Basic Classes (ABC), the Method Resolution Order (MRO), and Mixins.
